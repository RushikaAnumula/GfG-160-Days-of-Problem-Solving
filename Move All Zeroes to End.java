/*You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed in place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.*/
